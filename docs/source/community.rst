Community groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Climate Risk Database has different community groups for the community members, depending on their role in the Climate Risk Database. Most of the registered members are Data Users. They engage with the data by creating data stories and using the data in different cases. The group of Data Users may consist of smaller groups, for example students of a particular University. Therefore, they can execute activities, such as start conversations, in their own group.
Some of the members are CRD Data Managers. They are data experts who validate and approve all layers that are uploaded to CRD. If you would like to join this group and be a Data Manager of the Climate Risk Database, send a message to the email address provided in the CRD Data Managers group description.

1.	Explore community groups by clicking **Community --> Community Groups** from the header menu.
2.	Click the header of the group you want to explore more detailed.
3.	Read about the activities of the group from the description. Explore sub-groups of that group by scrolling down.
