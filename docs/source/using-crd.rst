Community groups
****************

Climate Risk Database has different community groups for the community members, depending on their role in the Climate Risk Database. Most of the registered members are Data Users. They engage with the data by creating data stories and using the data in different cases. The group of Data Users may consist of smaller groups, for example students of a particular University. Therefore, they can execute activities, such as start conversations, in their own group.
Some of the members are CRD Data Managers. They are data experts who validate and approve all layers that are uploaded to CRD. If you would like to join this group and be a Data Manager of the Climate Risk Database, send a message to the email address provided in the CRD Data Managers group description.

1.	Explore community groups by clicking **Community --> Community Groups** from the header menu.

layers
^^^^^^

Layers, i.e. geospatial datasets are the main content of the Climate Risk Database.
The number of high-quality layers is increasing and thus they serve ever growing group of potential users. Browse through the layers, or search for a specific theme.
This section provides some hints how to start browsing.

Explore layers
**************

The most important feature of Climate Risk Database is the geospatial data repository.
Explore all geospatial datasets published in the CRD, view them on a map and download them to your own use.

  1.	Explore all geospatial datasets by clicking **Layers** from the header menu.
  2.	Search layers with free-text words, or filter them by the spatial representation type (vector or raster) and theme categories. You can also sort the layers by clicking the small clock-and-arrow symbol in the right-hand side of the page.
  3.	Notice that layers are spread on multiple pages! Search through the pages at the bottom of the page.
  4.	When you find the layer you are looking for, click the title to access more detailed information about that layer.
