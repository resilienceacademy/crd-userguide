Metadata
========

Metadata describes the dataset and its lineage, and therefore it is as crucial an element as the geospatial dataset itself. All datasets published in the Climate Risk Database must have metadata in a standardized format.

The Climate Risk Database follows the International Organization for Standardization’s metadata standards. More detailed, the ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata standard.

Example: `Nungwi <https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/layers/geonode_data:geonode:nungwi_trees#more>`_ Trees dataset has a great set of metadata. The dataset, the collection process and the project behind it has been clearly explained, as well as the consistency and completeness of the data.

A comprehensive open online learning course regarding geospatial metadata can be found from Resilience Academy’s Digicampus profile (requires Gmail registration): -	`Module 2: Geospatial data quality & management <https://digicampus.fi/course/view.php?id=493>`_

Attribute metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Attribute metadata describes the attributes of vector datasets. Attribute metadata must be created for all vector datasets - the information about attribute names, their description, value type and value range helps the data user to understand what the attributes mean and how they can be used.
The Climate Risk Database follows the International Organization for Standardization’s metadata standards (ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata) with minor modifications.

Example: `Dar es Salaam Historical Flood Depths <https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/layers/geonode_data:geonode:dar_es_salaam_historical_flood_depths>`_ has a great set of attribute metadata (click **Attributes** under the map).
