Quality control
===============

Before the dataset can be published for the wider audience, the CRD Data managers’ team will quality check it and make sure the data meets CRD’s data quality requirements and standards. To read more about these, please see the section above “Data quality standards”.

The CRD Data managers’ team will use the following instructions to run a systematic quality control for the data. These quality control instructions are created to match the data quality requirements and standards discussed above. You as a data provider are also free to use these documents to guide your work.

-	`Quality control instructions (raster) <https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/documents/158>`_

In case of quality issues or further questions, the CRD Data managers’ team will contact you. Usually questions are related to metadata which needs additional information. When the quality check is done and the CRD Data managers’ team has approved your dataset, it will be published. You will be informed when the data is up and running and ready to be downloaded
