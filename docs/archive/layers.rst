Explore layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most important feature of Climate Risk Database is the geospatial data repository.
Explore all geospatial datasets published in the CRD, view them on a map and download them to your own use.

1.	Explore all geospatial datasets by clicking Layers from the header menu.
2.	Search layers with free-text words, or filter them by the spatial representation type (vector or raster) and theme categories. You can also sort the layers by clicking the small clock-and-arrow symbol in the right-hand side of the page.
3.	Notice that layers are spread on multiple pages! Search through the pages at the bottom of the page.
4.	When you find the layer you are looking for, click the title to access more detailed information about that layer.

Layer page
^^^^^^^^^^

Layer page contains a preview and metadata of the layer in questions, downloading options and other functions.

1.	Explore the layer, information and actions attached to it by scrolling the layer page and using the functions.
2.	In the map window, you can zoom and pan the layer, and even query the layer objects. Just click any of the layer objects (points, lines, areas or cells) and a pop-up window appears with information about that object.
3.	Tabs below the map window hold information of metadata, attributes, as well as social activities. You can share, rate and comment all datasets when you are signed in.
4.	The bar in the right holds additional information and actions. You find links to maps where the layer is used, and the documents that are attached to the layer. If there are multiple different styles attached to the layer, you can choose between them to view them in the map window.

Layer metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.	Below the map view of the layer, you find the most important metadata of the layer from the tab Info. Scroll down and click More info to see additional metadata.
2.	To view more detailed metadata, click Metadata Detail from the right-hand side of the map window.
3.	If you want to save the metadata information to view later, click Download Metadata from the right-hand side of the map window. Here, choose the format you want to download the metadata in. If you are not familiar with XML-formats, choose the HTML format, copy and save the link from the search bar.
4.	The most important pieces of metadata are the Abstract and Owner of the layer. If you have anything to ask regarding the layer, click the name of the owner organization, and send an email to the address that can be found from their profile page.
