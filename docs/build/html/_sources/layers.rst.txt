Explore layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most important feature of Climate Risk Database is the geospatial data repository.
Explore all geospatial datasets published in the CRD, view them on a map and download them to your own use.

1.	Explore all geospatial datasets by clicking Layers from the header menu.
2.	Search layers with free-text words, or filter them by the spatial representation type (vector or raster) and theme categories. You can also sort the layers by clicking the small clock-and-arrow symbol in the right-hand side of the page.
3.	Notice that layers are spread on multiple pages! Search through the pages at the bottom of the page.
4.	When you find the layer you are looking for, click the title to access more detailed information about that layer.
