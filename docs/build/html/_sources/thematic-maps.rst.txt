Thematic Maps
=============

Layers that are uploaded to CRD can be used in various maps, which are made by our community members.
(Thematic) maps can be very informative and a powerful way of information communication, and they, for example, represent phenomena, show multiple layers at once to compare, and act as a tool to evaluate risks.
